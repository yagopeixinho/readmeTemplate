## About the Project
In a society where we consume more and more information, it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to remember the small details...

When we go to the market we realize this. That is why vouAoMercado! was created with the purpose of solving this problem, being a list manager to use when you go to the market, ensuring that you never forget that milk, strawberry, or coffee again.

## Why

At first this project was born as a personal need, because whenever I went to the market I ended up forgetting something. 

I realized, however, that I could make this project a collective solution, because after talking to some friends and developers, I realized that it is a very common problem. 



## Project Notes
- This project stores the information in localStorage, i.e. the information is saved directly in your browser, so when you clear the cache all the information disappears.

- On some screens an _input color_ is indicated, suggesting the color of some interface. It is _strongly recommended_ that you use pastel colors and avoid oversaturated colors for the best visual experience.

- The project's interface is in Brazilian Portuguese.
